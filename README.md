#COMP20: WEB PROGRAMMING
 

1. Purpose:

   The purpose of this repository is to have a portfolio which consists of the code I wrote for all the assignments and labs of the COMP20:Web Programming course. This would make it easier for me to use the code I wrote for this class for future references. 

2. Favorite assignment:

	My favorite asssignment was Assignment 2: Landmarks. I felt that I managed to learn a lot on client-side code through that assignment, and I also learned how to work with the Google Maps API which I went on to use further in the semester group project. 

3. How much do you think you have grown from Day 1 of this course to now?

	I feel that I have had significant development in Web Programming throughout this course. I came into this course without any prior experience in Web Development or any working knowledge of Javascript, MongoDB, etc. However, all the lab assignments along with the larger homework projects that I worked on helped me understand all the important concepts and their applications. Working on the Landmarks project was particulary interesting. I was able to implement both the server and client-side code successfully, which gave me a lot of confidence. Also, I taught myself a lot of new concepts such as Bootstrap, Facebook API, etc. for the group project, which I believe will be very helpful for me in future given that Computer Science is an area where self-teaching is immensely important. 

4. What was the most important thing you learned?

	As stated above, self-teaching new concepts is something really important that I managed to learn throughout this course. In addition, gaining experience in a new programming language(JavaScript) was very helpful as I did not have proficiency in languages other than C and C++ before taking this course. 

5. What topic would you want to learn deeper?

	I plan on learning MySQL database, and most importantly web security. Security is immensely important in web development, so if I could delve deeper into it I would be greatly benefited.
