# Webpage that loads JSON data using XMLHttpRequest, parses the JSON file and
then outputs the data to an HTML file

# Approx. hours spent - 2

# Answer to supplement question:

  It is NOT possible to request the data from a different origin or from the
  local machine using XMLHttpRequest beause of the same-origin policy. According
  to the same-origin policy, a web browser will only allow the scripts in a
  web-page to access data from another web-page if both the pages have the same
  origin.
